            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Why We Built It</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
            FitCents started as a passion project by <strong>Jorge Jacob Toledo</strong>â€”a mining engineer turned full-stack developer. I built this during coding bootcamp to solve a real-life problem I faced: how to eat right while staying within budget. This app reflects my growth, discipline, and deep desire to create something truly useful.
