            <p className="text-gray-700">
            FitCents started as a passion project by <strong>Jorge Jacob Toledo</strong> â€” a mining engineer turned full-stack developer.
            I built this during coding bootcamp to solve a real-life problem I faced: how to eat right while staying within budget.
            This app reflects my growth, discipline, and deep desire to create something truly useful.
